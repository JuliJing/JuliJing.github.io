# Juli Jing, PhD
### Postdoctoral Associate on plant molecular biology and breeding

## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
- 8+ years of experience in plant meiosis, breeding, molecular biology, genetics, genome editing and biochemistry.  
- Highly experienced in design and conduct complex experiments, demonstrated ability to troubleshooting and multi-tasks:  
Identified 5 novel maize genes and elucidated their critical roles. Discovered two new meiotic recombination regulators  
which has great application prospects on plant breeding. Completed 9 projects, published 10 high impact peer-review  
publications, invented one patent, won top postdoctoral fellowship.  
- Strong experience on genome editing: knocked out 4 genes by CRISPR/Cas9 in maize and Arabidopsis, proficient in  
molecular cloning, Agrobacterium transformation and tissue culture.  
- Strong experience on molecular cloning, constructed ~60 vectors and successful application of them on CRISPR/Cas9, yeast  
two hybrid, protein expression, split luciferase assay and sub-cellular localization.  
- Deep expertise in DNA repair mechanism: Identified 3 meiotic DNA repair genes in maize. Published one review about  
DNA recombination and repair mechanism. Reviewed one manuscript about DNA repair mechanism.  
- Leadership: Established maize cytology and yeast-two hybrid experimental platform for my PhD lab. Mentored 5 students  
in several meiosis gene functional identification projects.  
- Collaboration and teamwork: Completed 5 collaborative projects with multidisciplinary groups from top research  
institutes in China, USA, Germany and France.  
- Communication: Hosted 3 years of department seminar and journal club, well-received presentations and posters are  
selected for 3 international conferences. Trained students and colleagues on molecular biology, cytology and biochemistry  
techniques.
